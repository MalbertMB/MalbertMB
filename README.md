## Selected Work

### Hybrid Phishing Detection System  
A dual-layer architecture combining Q-Learning with a KNN fallback classifier to improve robustness against zero-day phishing URLs. Designed to balance adaptive learning with deterministic safety mechanisms.

### Geospatial Social Review Platform  
Full-stack Android application built with real-time backend synchronization and cloud storage integration. Focused on scalable architecture and reactive data handling.

### Volatility-Adjusted Trading Framework *(in development)* 
An automated trading system integrating technical indicators with risk-adjusted performance metrics. Built around reproducible quantitative evaluation.

### Algorithmic & ML Research Projects  
- Multinomial Naive Bayes language detection engine  
- Heuristic collaborative filtering recommender system  
- Financial time-series predictive models  

Each project emphasizes structured design, mathematical grounding, and implementation efficiency.
